# **Abstract** 

College students often face the challenge of balancing limited income with the growing costs of education and everyday living. Managing expenses such as housing, transportation, food, school-related costs, and personal spending can become difficult, particularly when income comes from multiple or irregular sources. Finora is a financial management system designed specifically for college students to provide greater visibility into their finances and support better financial decision-making. The project aims to help students organize their money, plan for upcoming expenses, and build healthier financial habits while navigating college life.  
Finora will provide students with a centralized way to record income and expenses, organize transactions into meaningful categories, establish budgets, set savings goals, and review their spending patterns. Income may include employment earnings, financial aid, scholarships, refunds, and other sources commonly available to students. In addition to tracking financial activity, Finora will consider recurring and nonrecurring financial obligations to give users a more realistic understanding of the money they have available for discretionary spending. Financial warnings will notify students when their spending could place their budgets or goals at risk. By combining financial organization, planning, and awareness, Finora seeks to help students make thoughtful decisions about their money while balancing current expenses with future financial priorities.
